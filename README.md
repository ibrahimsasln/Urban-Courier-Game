# Urban Courier Game (Unity 2D)

This is my first Unity game (top-down delivery game) from the GameDev.tv Udemy course.

I followed the lessons and also tried to solve the small challenges by myself. 

## How to Play
- Move: W/S  
- Steer: A/D  
- Pick up: drive through ice-cream pickups  
- Deliver: drive into a customer  
- Boost: drive through a boost pickup (temporary speed increase)  
- Collisions: hitting obstacles cancels the boost and resets speed

## What I practiced and learned
- C# scripts and MonoBehaviour basics
- Movement + steering with `Time.deltaTime`
- Collisions and triggers (`OnTriggerEnter2D`, `OnCollisionEnter2D`)
- Simple game logic (pickup → delivery flow)
- Speed boost system (temporary speed change + reset on collision)
- Particle effects for feedback
- Basic UI with TextMesh Pro
- Project organization and Git/GitHub basics
